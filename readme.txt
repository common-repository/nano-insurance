If you are frustrated about poor customer reviews or abandoned carts, you’re in luck. This application integrates into the checkout, offering to protect your customer’s shipping risk.


== Description ==

Drastically improve your conversion rates. If your customers know their purchase is insured, they are less likely to click away from the checkout page. In addition, you will earn a percentage in commission of all policies sold through your store! The plugin depends on a 3rd party service - https://www.nanoinsurancelimited.com. This plugin collects relevant information about orders made on your store as well as product categories in order to calculate the insurance premium and to properly respond to your customers' claims in case of a lost or damaged shipment.


== Installation ==

*Merchants must obtain an API key and verification code from https://woocommerce.nanoinsurancelimited.com/ and enter credit card details as the premiums generated will be collected on regular basis from the merchant for all policies sold.*

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

1. What does the application do?

Integrates into the cart of a WooCommerce store with a simple way to insure the transit of the item purchased by your customers.


2. What things are my customers insured for?

Basically, if the item is damaged in transit, or lost along the way, we will replace it with another item. Nano is a fully licenced insurance company.


3. What does a customer pay to be insured?

Our rates start at 1% of the purchase price of the item.


4. What happens after they purchase the insurance?

Customer receives an email confirming their item is insured with a copy of the Insurance Certificate and policy number. We also include a link for the customer to make a claim, if necessary. We include the link to the full policy wording.


5. What happens if they make a complaint - do I do anything?

No, Nano will handle any issues which happen in transit (lost or damaged items). If there is a dispute about the item itself, we will happily field the first call and try to help.


6. What do I pay for the app?

Nothing. The app is free to install. After a customer purchases a policy, you, the merchant, keep 10% of the premium and pass the remaining 90% to us. We collect that 90% on a monthly basis. In other words: you don't pay to install or integrate Nano Insurance onto your store, and you make a commission on all policies sold.
